# Classification of x-ray images

# This project is designed to classify X-ray images into 3 classes: frontal, lateral, trash

## Neural network VGG9 was used, which was further trained on the training data set and tested.

## A csv file is created that contains the activation values ​​for each photo in the test sample. The model weights are also saved for future use.

# The accuracy of the model is 95%
